# Landing Page HTML and CSS Practice

## Purpose
While the idea of HTML and CSS make sense seperately, pulling them together to create something from scratch has been a weak spot for myself. Making this repository allowed me to practice building out a portfolio homepage from start to finish.

## Future Goals
I plan to make some other pages on this website in order to learn other layouts, linking, and to become faster and more comfortable with the work. (04/05/2019)
